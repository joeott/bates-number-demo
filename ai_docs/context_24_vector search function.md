# Setting Up a Pinecone Vector Search Tool with Langchain Integration

This document guides you through setting up a Pinecone vector search tool, uploading documents to a Pinecone Assistant, and creating a command-line retriever. It also outlines how to integrate this setup into a Langchain flow for advanced codebase analysis using a specified GPT model.

## Prerequisites

*   **Pinecone Account:** You need an active Pinecone account and an API key. You can sign up at [Pinecone's website](https://www.pinecone.io/).
*   **Python Environment:** Python 3.7+ installed.
*   **Target Directory:** Instructions assume scripts will be placed in `/Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/`. Please create this directory if it doesn't exist.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/
    ```

## 1. Install SDK and Plugin

To interact with Pinecone and use the Pinecone Assistant features, install or upgrade the necessary Python package. The user-provided snippet for chatting uses `pinecone_plugins.assistant`. This typically requires the main `pinecone` package and potentially a specific plugin or an extra.

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
pip install --upgrade "pinecone[assistant]"
```
This command attempts to install the `pinecone` package along with the optional dependencies for assistant functionality. If `pinecone_plugins.assistant` still results in an import error, you may need to consult Pinecone's documentation for the correct package or plugin name compatible with the `pc.assistant.Assistant` and `pinecone_plugins.assistant.models.chat.Message` usage from your snippets. The core installation from your prompt is:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pinecone
```
You might need to install an additional plugin separately if the above doesn't cover `pinecone_plugins`.

## 2. Configure Pinecone Assistant

Before using the scripts, ensure you have a Pinecone Assistant created and configured in your Pinecone account:

1.  **Create an Assistant**:
    *   Log in to your Pinecone console.
    *   Navigate to the "Assistants" section and create a new assistant.
    *   Name this assistant `legal-doc-processor-codebase`, as this name is used in the provided example scripts.

2.  **Configure LLM (Model)**:
    *   During the assistant setup in the Pinecone console, or through its API if available for configuration, you need to specify the underlying language model.
    *   Set the model to `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`.
    *   The Python SDK snippets for chatting (`assistant.chat(...)`) typically do not include a parameter to set the model per-call, so this configuration is usually done at the assistant level within the Pinecone platform.

## 3. Upload Files to Pinecone Assistant

This script will upload files from your local machine to the `legal-doc-processor-codebase` Pinecone Assistant. These files will be processed and indexed by the assistant, making their content available for retrieval and chat.

Create a Python script named `upload_to_assistant.py` in the `/Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/` directory with the following content:

```python
# /Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/upload_to_assistant.py
from pinecone import Pinecone
import os

# --- Configuration ---
PINECONE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Pinecone API key
ASSISTANT_NAME = "legal-doc-processor-codebase"

# List of file paths to upload. Modify this list as needed.
# Example:
FILES_TO_UPLOAD = [
    "/Users/jdoe/Downloads/example_file.txt",
    # "/path/to/your/code_file.py",
    # "/path/to/your/document.md",
]
# For a dynamic list, you could use glob:
# import glob
# FILES_TO_UPLOAD = glob.glob("/path/to/your/codebase_docs/**/*.py", recursive=True)
# --- End Configuration ---

def upload_files_to_assistant(api_key: str, assistant_name: str, file_paths: list[str]):
    """
    Initializes the Pinecone client, gets a handle to the assistant,
    and uploads specified files.
    """
    if not api_key or api_key == "YOUR_API_KEY":
        print("Error: PINECONE_API_KEY is not set. Please replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key in the script.")
        return

    print(f"Initializing Pinecone client...")
    try:
        pc = Pinecone(api_key=api_key)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing Pinecone client: {e}")
        return

    try:
        print(f"Connecting to assistant: '{assistant_name}'...")
        # Get a handle to an existing assistant.
        # This assistant must be created in your Pinecone account first.
        assistant = pc.assistant.Assistant(assistant_name=assistant_name)
        print("Successfully connected to assistant.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to assistant '{assistant_name}': {e}")
        print("Please ensure the assistant exists and your API key has the correct permissions.")
        return

    if not file_paths:
        print("No files specified for upload. Please update FILES_TO_UPLOAD in the script.")
        return

    for file_path in file_paths:
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            print(f"File not found: {file_path}. Skipping.")
            continue

        print(f"Uploading file: {file_path} to assistant '{assistant_name}'...")
        try:
            # The example uses `assistant.upload_file(file_path="...")`
            response = assistant.upload_file(file_path=file_path, timeout=None) # timeout=None for potentially large files
            # The response structure from upload_file can vary.
            # Pinecone's example doesn't specify what 'response' contains for upload_file.
            # We'll assume success if no exception is raised.
            print(f"Successfully initiated upload for: {file_path}. Response: {response}")
        except AttributeError as e:
            print(f"AttributeError: {e}. The 'assistant' object may not have 'upload_file' method or it's used incorrectly.")
            print("Please check your Pinecone SDK version and assistant object type.")
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error uploading file {file_path}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_files_to_assistant(PINECONE_API_KEY, ASSISTANT_NAME, FILES_TO_UPLOAD)
    print("File upload process finished.")

```

**Instructions for `upload_to_assistant.py`:**
1.  **Replace Placeholder:** Open the script and change `PINECONE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"` to your actual Pinecone API key.
2.  **Specify Files:** Update the `FILES_TO_UPLOAD` list with the full paths to the documents or codebase files you want to ingest.
3.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python /Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/upload_to_assistant.py
    ```
    This command directs the script to ingest the specified files into your `legal-doc-processor-codebase` assistant in Pinecone.

## 4. Command-Line Retriever for Pinecone Assistant

This script sets up a command-line interface to chat with your Pinecone Assistant. It allows you to ask questions and receive responses generated by the assistant (using `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` as configured) based on the content of the uploaded documents.

Create a Python script named `query_assistant.py` in the `/Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/` directory with the following content:

```python
# /Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/query_assistant.py
from pinecone import Pinecone
from pinecone_plugins.assistant.models.chat import Message
# Note: If 'pinecone_plugins.assistant.models.chat import Message' causes an ImportError,
# you may need to:
# 1. Ensure you've installed the correct Pinecone package/plugin (e.g., pip install "pinecone[assistant]").
# 2. Find the updated import path for `Message` in your version of the Pinecone SDK.
#    It might be part of `pinecone.models.chat` or similar.

# --- Configuration ---
PINECONE_API_KEY = "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Pinecone API key
ASSISTANT_NAME = "legal-doc-processor-codebase"
# --- End Configuration ---

def chat_with_assistant(api_key: str, assistant_name: str):
    """
    Initializes the Pinecone client, connects to the assistant,
    and enters a loop to chat from the command line.
    """
    if not api_key or api_key == "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY":
        print("Error: PINECONE_API_KEY is not set. Please replace 'YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY' with your actual key in the script.")
        return

    print("Initializing Pinecone client...")
    try:
        pc = Pinecone(api_key=api_key)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing Pinecone client: {e}")
        return

    try:
        print(f"Connecting to assistant: '{assistant_name}'...")
        assistant = pc.assistant.Assistant(assistant_name=assistant_name)
        print(f"Successfully connected to assistant '{assistant_name}'.")
        print("You can now ask questions. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the chat.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to assistant '{assistant_name}': {e}")
        print("Please ensure the assistant exists, is correctly named, and your API key is valid.")
        return

    while True:
        try:
            user_query = input("\nYour question: ")
        except KeyboardInterrupt: # Allow Ctrl+C to exit
            print("\nExiting chat.")
            break
        
        if user_query.lower() in ['exit', 'quit']:
            print("Exiting chat.")
            break

        # Create a message object using the class from your snippet
        # The Message model might require a 'role', typically "user" for user input.
        # If not specified, the default might be "user" or it might error.
        # Let's assume content is the primary field as per your snippet.
        try:
            msg = Message(content=user_query)
            # If 'role' is required: msg = Message(content=user_query, role="user")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error creating Message object: {e}. Check the Message class definition/requirements.")
            continue
            
        # Option 1: Get response as a single message (non-streaming)
        # Based on your snippet: resp = assistant.chat(messages=[msg]); print(resp["message"]["content"])
        print("\nAssistant (non-streaming):")
        try:
            resp = assistant.chat(messages=[msg]) # Pass the message list
            if isinstance(resp, dict) and "message" in resp and isinstance(resp["message"], dict) and "content" in resp["message"]:
                print(resp["message"]["content"])
            else:
                print("Received an unexpected response format (non-streaming).")
                print(f"Full response object: {resp}")

        except AttributeError as e:
            print(f"AttributeError: {e}. The 'assistant' object may not have a 'chat' method.")
            print("Please check your Pinecone SDK version and assistant object type.")
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during non-streaming chat: {e}")

        # Option 2: Get response as a stream of chunks (as in your snippet)
        # print("\nAssistant (streaming):")
        # try:
        #     chunks = assistant.chat(messages=[msg], stream=True)
        #     for chunk in chunks:
        #         if chunk: # The original snippet's 'if chunk:' condition
        #             # 'chunk' could be a string or an object.
        #             # If it's an object, you might need to access a specific attribute like chunk.content or chunk.text
        #             # For simple text streaming, print(chunk, end="", flush=True) is common.
        #             print(chunk, end="", flush=True) 
        #     print() # Add a newline after the stream is complete
        # except Exception as e:
        #     print(f"Error during streaming chat: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat_with_assistant(PINECONE_API_KEY, ASSISTANT_NAME)

```

**Instructions for `query_assistant.py`:**
1.  **Replace Placeholder:** Open the script and change `PINECONE_API_KEY = "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"` to your actual Pinecone API key.
2.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python /Users/josephott/Downloads/Untitled/utils/query_assistant.py
    ```
3.  **Interact:** Type your questions at the prompt and press Enter. The assistant will respond. Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session. The script defaults to non-streaming responses; you can uncomment the streaming section if preferred.

## 5. Langchain Flow for Advanced Codebase Analysis

The scripts above allow direct interaction with the Pinecone Assistant. To implement the advanced Langchain flow for codebase analysis (recursive search, definition identification, conformity analysis), you will integrate this Pinecone setup with Langchain.

**Core Requirements for the Langchain Flow:**
1.  Utilize the ingested documents in the `legal-doc-processor-codebase` Pinecone Assistant as the knowledge source.
2.  Recursively search the codebase (via Pinecone) for column, field, and other definitions.
3.  Identify these references by script name and line number.
4.  Analyze whether these references conform with another specified document (rules/guidelines document).
5.  Use `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` as the primary LLM for analysis and response generation within the Langchain flow.

**Conceptual Langchain Implementation Outline:**

This is a high-level guide. The actual implementation will be complex and require custom logic.

1.  **Langchain Retriever Configuration:**
    *   You need to make the data in your Pinecone Assistant accessible as a Langchain `Retriever`.
    *   **Option A (Custom Wrapper):** If Langchain doesn't have a direct integration for `Pinecone Assistant` objects, you might need to write a custom Langchain `Retriever` class that uses `pc.assistant.Assistant(...)` and its `chat()` method (or a similar query method) under the hood. This retriever would take a query string and return Langchain `Document` objects.
    *   **Option B (Direct Index Access with Langchain):** If your Pinecone Assistant is built upon a standard Pinecone serverless index, you can likely connect Langchain directly to this index using `PineconeVectorStore` (from `langchain-pinecone`). This is often more straightforward for Langchain integrations.
        ```python
        # Example using Langchain's PineconeVectorStore (requires knowing the index name)
        # from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
        # from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings # Or your preferred embedding model

        # PINECONE_INDEX_NAME = "your-assistant-s-underlying-index-name" # Find this in Pinecone console
        # embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() # Ensure this matches embeddings used by assistant

        # vectorstore = PineconeVectorStore.from_existing_index(
        #     index_name=PINECONE_INDEX_NAME,
        #     embedding=embeddings
        # )
        # retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5}) # Retrieve top 5 results
        ```

2.  **Langchain LLM Setup:**
    *   Configure Langchain to use `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`. (Note: As of mid-2024, `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` is a placeholder model name. Use the actual model identifier provided by OpenAI or your LLM provider once available.)
        ```python
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Or other provider for the specified GPT model

        # Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
        llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", temperature=0.0)
        ```

3.  **Core Logic for Codebase Analysis (Custom Chain/Agent):**
    This part will involve significant custom Python code orchestrated by Langchain.

    *   **Input Processing:** The flow starts with a user query (e.g., "Find all definitions of 'customer_email' and check their conformity against document X").
    *   **Retrieval of Code Snippets:** Use the Langchain retriever (connected to Pinecone) to fetch relevant code snippets or entire files from the ingested codebase.
    *   **Definition Extraction & Contextualization:**
        *   For each retrieved document (code snippet):
            *   Parse the code to identify definitions of columns, fields, etc. (using regex, AST parsers like Python's `ast` module, or tree-sitter).
            *   Extract script name (ideally from metadata stored with vectors in Pinecone).
            *   Determine line numbers for these definitions.
        *   This step might be iterative. The LLM could guide this by generating parsing tasks or identifying relevant patterns.
    *   **Recursive Search (if needed):**
        *   If a definition references another item or if the scope needs to be expanded, the LLM can formulate follow-up queries to the retriever. This suggests an Agent-based approach or a chain with conditional logic.
    *   **Conformity Analysis against "Another Document":**
        *   **Access the "Other Document":** This document (containing rules, standards, or schema definitions) needs to be loaded. It could be a local file, a URL, or even another document retrievable via a separate Pinecone index.
        *   **Comparison Task:** For each identified definition and its context (script, line number), create a prompt for the LLM (`gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`). This prompt should include:
            1.  The extracted code definition.
            2.  Its context (file name, line number).
            3.  The relevant rules/specifications from the "other document."
            4.  A clear instruction to analyze conformity.
        *   The LLM's response will indicate whether it conforms and potentially why.

4.  **Structuring with Langchain (LCEL or Agents):**
    *   **LCEL (Langchain Expression Language):** For a more defined, sequential flow, LCEL is powerful.
        ```python
        # Highly conceptual LCEL chain structure
        # from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
        # from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser, JsonOutputParser
        # from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableLambda

        # def parse_code_for_definitions(docs_and_query): # Custom function
        #     # ... your parsing logic ...
        #     return [{"definition": "...", "file": "...", "line": ...}, ...]

        # def load_rules_document(rules_doc_id): # Custom function
        #     # ... load your rules ...
        #     return "Rules content..."

        # # Prompt for conformity analysis
        # conformity_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        #     "Definition: {definition_info.definition}\n"
        #     "File: {definition_info.file}, Line: {definition_info.line}\n"
        #     "Rules: {rules}\n\n"
        #     "Analyze conformity and explain."
        # )

        # # Define how to get definitions from retrieved docs
        # definition_extraction_chain = RunnableLambda(parse_code_for_definitions)

        # # Main chain part for one definition
        # analysis_chain_for_one_definition = (
        #     {"definition_info": RunnablePassthrough(), "rules": RunnableLambda(load_rules_document)}
        #     | conformity_prompt
        #     | llm
        #     | StrOutputParser()
        # )
        
        # # Overall flow would retrieve, then map analysis_chain_for_one_definition over results
        # # This is simplified; actual recursive search and aggregation are more complex
        ```
    *   **Langchain Agents:** If the process involves dynamic decision-making, tool use (e.g., a code parser tool, a file system tool), and iterative refinement, an Agent setup would be more suitable. You would define tools for retrieving code, parsing code, and looking up rules, and the LLM (as an agent) would decide when and how to use these tools.

5.  **Output Generation:**
    *   Aggregate the analysis results for all identified definitions.
    *   Present a comprehensive report to the user, listing each definition, its location, and its conformity status.

**Key Considerations for Langchain Flow:**
*   **Metadata:** Ensure that when you upload codebase files to Pinecone, you include metadata like file names/paths. This is crucial for identifying sources.
*   **Chunking Strategy:** How you chunk your code files for Pinecone indexing will affect retrieval. Semantic chunking of code can be challenging.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts for definition extraction, recursive search guidance, and conformity analysis is critical.
*   **Error Handling and Iteration:** This kind of complex analysis will require robust error handling and potentially iterative refinement of queries and analysis steps.

This detailed Langchain flow represents a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application. The Pinecone Assistant provides the "Retrieval" part, and Langchain with `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` orchestrates the "Augmentation" and "Generation" for the advanced analysis.
