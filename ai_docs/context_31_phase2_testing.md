# Context 31: Phase 2 Testing - Core Component Verification

## Phase 2 Testing Overview

This document tracks the systematic testing of the iterative retriever components using production data.

## Test Environment
- Vector Store: Populated with 145 document pages
- Database: PostgreSQL with document_pages and document_texts tables
- LLM: Ollama with qwen2.5:latest model
- LangSmith: Enabled for tracing

## Test Execution Log

### Test 1: Vector Search Tool Verification
**Objective**: Verify the vector search tool can successfully query the vector store

**Test Date**: 2025-01-08

**Results**:
- ✅ Vector search tool functional
- ✅ Returns results with metadata
- ⚠️ Vector store contains mostly deposition transcripts
- ⚠️ Chunks are very small (often just page markers)
- ⚠️ No Brentwood Glass contract documents found in initial searches

### Test 2: Query Understanding Chain
**Objective**: Verify LLM can decompose complex queries

**Results**:
- ✅ Successfully parses user queries
- ✅ Generates relevant sub-queries
- ✅ Identifies appropriate keywords
- ✅ Suggests metadata filters (category: "Pleading")

### Test 3: Fact Extraction Chain  
**Objective**: Verify LLM can extract facts from chunks

**Results**:
- ✅ Successfully processes text chunks
- ✅ Identifies relevance correctly
- ⚠️ May hallucinate specific values (changed $275k to $150k in test)

### Test 4: Full CLI Execution
**Objective**: End-to-end retrieval with production data

**Results**:
- ✅ CLI executes without crashes
- ✅ All chains work together
- ✅ Graceful handling of no results
- ❌ No relevant facts found for "contract price" queries
- ⚠️ Vector store may not contain the expected legal documents
